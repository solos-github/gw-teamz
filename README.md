# gw-teamz
gw-teamz repository
gwteamz is selfmade tool of mine to extend the functionality of the game guildwars 1 by arenanet. 
The tool is an extension to my old tool "zaishen-info". No official tool to be used, its third party.
It allows to see the daily ingame quests/missions. It will allow players to look for teammates to play with and buy/sell items. 
The tool is able to communicate to guildwars via public gwa2,
to get groupsize, playername or current location, that makes it easier to setup a "looking for group"
